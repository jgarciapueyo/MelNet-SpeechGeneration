"""Implementation of the Delayed Stack Layer.

Implementation of the stacks that compose the Delayed Stack as explained in Section 4 of the MelNet
paper. A Delayed Stack Layer is composed of three stacks:
- Time-delayed stack: composed of three RNN (forward in time, forward in frequency and backward in
                      frequency)
- Frequency-delayed stack: composed of one RNN (forward in frequency)
- Centralized stack: composed of one RNN (forward in time)

For more information, see: notebooks/06_DelayedStackDimensions.ipynb
# TODO: finish explanation in notebooks/06_DelayedStackDimensions.ipynb

.. Note:
    We expect the spectrogram to have shape: [B, FREQ, FRAMES] where B is batch size

    Explanation of axis of one of the spectrogram in the batch, which has shape [FREQ, FRAMES]:

    high frequencies  M +------------------------+
                        |     | |                |
         FREQ = j       |     | | <- a frame     |
                        |     | |                |
    low frequencies   0 +------------------------+
                        0                        T
                   start time    FRAMES = i    final time

    As the paper describes:
    - row major ordering
    - a frame is x_(i,*)
    - which proceeds through each frame from low to high frequency
