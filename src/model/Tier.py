"""Implementation of the Tier.

In MelNet, the Tier is the basic unit in the multiscale modelling as explained in Section 6 of the
MelNet paper. A Tier is composed of Delayed Stack Layers and, at the final layer, a linear
transformation to the output (hidden state) of the frequency-delayed stack to produce the
unconstrained parameters: mu_hat, std_hat, pi_hat.

For more information, see notebooks/07_TierDimensionsAndParameters.ipynb
# TODO: finish explanation in notebooks/07_TierDimensionsAndParameters.ipynb

.. Note:
    We expect the spectrogram to have shape: [B, FREQ, FRAMES] where B is batch size

    Explanation of axis of one of the spectrogram in the batch, which has shape [FREQ, FRAMES]:

    high frequencies  M +------------------------+
                        |     | |                |
         FREQ = j       |     | | <- a frame     |
                        |     | |                |
    low frequencies   0 +------------------------+
                        0                        T
                   start time    FRAMES = i    final time

    As the paper describes:
    - row major ordering
    - a frame is x_(i,*)
    - which proceeds through each frame from low to high frequency
